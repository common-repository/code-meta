== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do for my website? =

For your website to achieve top search engine rankings, every post type (posts, pages, projects and products) must have at least 300 words of content and associated categories and tags must be assigned to each type.

Code Meta builds the Opengraph meta tags the search engines use to help rank your website. There's no way to have a top ranked website without Opengraph meta tags.

= Will the Code Meta plugin build the Opengraph meta for my media files? =

Yes! In fact, it builds a complete array of all media files found on the page. This includes images, audio and video.

It could even help with "deep fakes", as mentioned above, by defining your provenance on the internet through the media EXIF tags.

= Will this work with custom post types? =

Code Meta tries hard to work with every post type, but that depends on the structure of the post type.

Code Meta tries to parse all post types, however, it may not get everything right with custom post types. It works with all native WordPress post types and Woocommerce products.

The public GitHub is available should you have any troubles with a custom post type: [CodeMilitant GitHub repository](https://github.com/CodeMilitant/code-meta/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=wp_org_repo_listing)

= Where do I setup the parameters for this plugin after it's installed? =

There are no paramters to setup. Just install, activate and forget about it.

The admin screen in the Code Meta menu will show you a sample of the actual meta tags generated from a random post type found on your website.

= Will Code Meta work with all ecommerce plugins? =

No, this plugin is only optimized for WooCommerce. Future premium versions may encompass more ecommerce solutions.

With that said, an alternate product post type, might get properly parsed and return the meta tags your website needs.

You have nothing to lose by trying it.

= Will this Code Meta plugin show my existing keywords and categories? =

Yes, but you have to add all these elements manually to your WordPress content. The Code SEO AI premium version will do this for you for a small monthly fee.

= Will the Code Meta plugin connect my social networks to my website? =

[Premium] Yes, the social network premium version is only $3 dollars (USD) per month for social network integration. Please see the Upgrade menu in the plugin.

= Will Code Meta help me build categories and keywords from my WordPress content? =

[Premium] Yes! The premium Code SEO AI version builds the categories and keyword phrases for a small monthly fee. Please see the Upgrade menu in the plugin.

= Will this generate Opengraph meta tags for media EXIF information? =

Yes, all image, audio and video files containing relevant EXIF information will be displayed in the Opengraph meta tags.

An array of Opengraph meta tags will be generated for all media found in the content.

= Does this plugin work with other Opengraph meta tag (SEO) generators? =

So other meta tag generator plugins will not crash your website, and neither will this plugin if there's another meta tag generator plugin already active.

However! If there are multiple Opengraph meta tag generators on the site, there will also be multiple sets of meta tags generated.

If there are multiple sets of meta tags, the search engines will not index your website properly due to a duplicate content violation.

= Does Code Meta translate into other languages? =

This plugin is setup for internationalization and should translate all languages native to the WordPress core.

= Does Code Meta add records to my database? =

Yes, but only your social profile usernames and links you provide. Unlike all other SEO plugins in the WordPress directory, the meta tags are efficiently generated through PHP and will persistently remain using any server or WordPress caching.

No database bloat, and no performance degradation.

= Will Code Meta slow my site down? =

No, because only the WordPress usermeta is accessed from the database , and the PHP is executed in a cascading topology, this plugin adds at most just 4 milliseconds (4/1000 of 1 second) to your website load time.

If your website is running server or WordPress caching, all the Opengraph meta tags will be stored in the cache and will add 0 milliseconds to load times.

= What is a PHP cascading topology? =

This is a coding style that executes code in a cascading (step-by-step) format. 

If a URL request is successful the code will efficiently execute step-by-step until complete.

If a URL request is an error, the entire plugin is ignored and returns all functionality to the WordPress core for processing.
